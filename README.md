Project Description
In the project, I aim to create a restaurant system where a customer can directly make his order and send it to the kitchen online. A customer can either login or signup and start making his order. Afterwards, he can monitor the status of his order if itâ€™s accepted or not. 
From the kitchen side, it can change the menu either by adding a dish or removing it.
